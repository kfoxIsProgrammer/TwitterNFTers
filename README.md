## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is determine if any relavent relationships could be gathered from analyzing NFT collection prices and Twitter Tweets that had been linked to those NFT collections. 


### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics 
* Data Scraping

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter, Dask
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Puppeteer 

## Project Description
This project included data from 2 sources. https://cryptoslam.io/ is a website that keeps track of NFT collection prices over time. By using a puppeteer web scraper, a dataset of 20 of the top NFT's were scrapped for the years of 2020 - 2022

The second source of data came from twitter. Using Twitters API2, we scrapped for NFT hashtags for as many tweets as possible. Each NFT Tweets were gathered for the period of January 2021 - March 2022. Depending on when each NFT was created, dates may vary.
